This is where fine needle aspiration comes in.

***The biopsy procedure can allow us to help make a diagnosis or rule out conditions such as cancer.***

# Conclusion
> As I continue my foray into machine learning I realize more and more just how powerful it is. 
> However while we are on the subject it is clear that machine learning can have revolutionary effects in healthcare. 
> This project has made that fact all the more apparent.
